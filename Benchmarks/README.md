This directory contains the benchmark code, TFLM library, and original source models

TFLM and the source tree are setup with the setup script in /Scripts.

The benchmark code under Int8, FP32, and FP16 is complete, no setup necessary

The models, input data, and output data can be re-generated for each benchmark using the scripts in the models/ folder.
